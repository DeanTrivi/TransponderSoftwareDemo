This repository has been made public as the patent-pending supervised umbilical transponder has had a hardware finalization and so this speedily-written demo code was replaced with a non-android-based, properly architected multi-service system that will be in the final patent.

There is a limited amount of support and few examples of Bluno BLE implementations, so hopefully this demo, used in the AWHONN 2023 conference in New Orleans, will demonstrate to those trying to use this chip how they can handle BLE communications with this board.
